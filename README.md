## Background
This is an assignment from IK2018:https://www.du.se/en/study-at-du/kurser/course/?code=IK2018
An imagined this case: You have a mountain cabin and are afraid that the indoor temp will be so cold that water pipes freeze. You are also afraid that it is so hot inside that the electrical elements in the cabin may be wrong. Now you want live data presented in a web page to be able to see in diagram form measured temperatures in the cottage. You want to get an email if the temperature drops below and exceeds certain temperature values so you can go up to the cabin to check out what may be wrong. For example, if it is -15 celsius outside and the sensor detects -100 inside then it is probably just wrong on the sensor or itâ€™s  some konc of fire:-(. But if it shows -3 celsius inside then it is probably wrong with the heating in the cabin and an email should be sent.
